  	<p> To be honest this is my first time doing anything regarding coding or working with comupter languages. I do not have anybackground in this, so I am always learning something new ans refreshing what I have learned from the HTML lessons and the extra tips and tricks Ms.Pais has told me through making this website.</p>
  	<h2> Interests </h2>
  	<p>  My main interest in this course is to learn how to write in minimum one of the coding languages that is exisitng thus far.</p>
  	<h2> Assignments Regarding Techology</h2>
  	<p> Currently, as of making this website I have no personal tech or coding projects that I am working on, again this is my first time doing work/assgnment regarding coding but I am thinking of trying or making another website and test other features of sublime and diffrent codes for animation etc. in my free time. </p>
